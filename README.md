# Welcome to "Darts"!
Your new home for scoring darts games is here. 

This is a passion project of mine using modern Android tech (Jetpack libraries, Material3, Hilt 
and others). After spending time using both chalk and pencil, I thought it would be fun to create 
my own project that will allow for exploration into new Android libraries and create something I 
will be able to use.
